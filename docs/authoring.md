# Authoring a standard with bblocks-specgen

This guide explains how to structure a repository so that `bblocks-specgen` can render it as
an OGC standards document. For installation and CLI/plugin options, see the
[README](../README.md).

## The idea

A standard is a **set of OGC Blocks** (bblocks) plus one file, `standards.yaml`, at the root
of the repository:

- each **clause** of the document is a bblock (its `description.md` is the clause text);
- a bblock that also carries a `requirements.yaml` is a **requirements class**;
- terms and references are bblocks carrying `terms.yaml` / `references.yaml`;
- `standards.yaml` gives the document metadata and lists which blocks make up the standard,
  in which order.

Nothing in `standards.yaml` is read by `bblocks-postprocess`; specgen reads it directly, and
reads the block sources from the repository (or, for blocks outside it, from their published
URLs).

```

├── bblocks-config.yaml        # identifier-prefix, plugins.build (see README)

                                examples.yaml, tests.yaml, … }
```

## `standards.yaml`

A list of standards, or a mapping with a top-level `standards` list. One repository can hold
several standards; each is written to `<build-dir>/<id>/index.html`.

```yaml
standards:
  - id: part1                       # required; letters, digits, _ and - only (output folder)
    prefix: my.std.part1            # required; identifier prefix of the blocks in this standard
    title: "My Standard - Part 1: Core"      # required
    base-uri: http://www.opengis.net/spec/my-std-1/1.0    # required

    req-uri-template:  "{base-uri}/{status}req/{id}"      # optional; these are the defaults
    conf-uri-template: "{base-uri}/{status}conf/{id}"
    class-id-prefix: my.std.part1.requirements.           # optional, see "Class ids"

    doc-number: OGC 24-001           # cover page
    type: Standard                   # default: Standard
    status: Draft                    # default: Draft
    version: "1.0.0"
    pub-date: null
    editors:
      - {name: Jane Doe, affiliation: Example Org}
    wg: Example SWG
    keywords: [OGC API, example]
    abstract: |
      What this standard specifies.
    boilerplate:
      copyright-year: 2026
      patent-policy: OGC RF          # adds the patent-policy warning when "OGC RF"
      license: OGC Document Notice   # adds the license agreement text when present

    clauses:                         # optional; document order, see below
      - my.std.part1.clauses.scope
      - {auto: conformance}
      - my.std.part1.clauses.terms
      - my.std.part1.requirements.core
      - {auto: annex-a}
      - my.std.part1.annexes.history
```

### URI templates

`{base-uri}` is the standard's `base-uri`; `{id}` is the requirement or class id;
`{status}` is `draft/` when `status` is `Draft` (case-insensitive) and empty otherwise. With
the defaults, requirements class `core` gets `…/1.0/draft/req/core` and conformance class
`…/1.0/draft/conf/core`.

### `clauses`

Entries are block identifiers (or `{bblock: <identifier>}`), in document order. Only blocks
whose identifier starts with `prefix` are considered; a missing block is a warning.

- `{auto: conformance}` — a conformance clause with a table of all requirements classes in
  the standard. It is numbered like any other clause, so put it where you want it.
- `{auto: annex-a}` — the Abstract Test Suite annex, generated from the requirements.
- **Annexes:** every prose, terms or references clause listed *after* `{auto: annex-a}` is
  numbered as an annex (B, C, …) instead of a numbered clause.

If `clauses` is omitted, blocks with a `clause-index` number in `bblock.json` are used, sorted
by it, with the conformance clause after the first block and the ATS annex last. Prefer an
explicit list: it keeps document structure in one place.

## How a block becomes part of the document

Which role each block gets is decided from its contents:

| The block… | Role |
|---|---|
| has `itemClass: terms` | terms and definitions clause (`terms.yaml`) |
| has `itemClass: references` | references clause (`references.yaml`) |
| has a `requirements.yaml` | requirements class — **whatever its `itemClass`** (so a `model` block can carry requirements) |
| none of the above | prose clause (`description.md`) |

After a run, `<build-dir>/<id>/report.json` lists every block that went in, the role it got
and why. Check it when something is not rendered the way you expect. A block with
`itemClass: clause` that also has a `requirements.yaml`, or `itemClass: requirements-class`
without one, produces a warning.

The block's `name` (from `bblock.json`) is the clause title. `normative: false` in
`bblock.json` marks a prose clause as informative.

## Prose clauses: `description.md`

Plain Markdown. Notes:

- **Headings** are shifted so that the shallowest heading in the file becomes `###` (the
  clause title itself is the `##`), and appear in the table of contents. Write the file as
  you would normally, starting with `#` or `##`.
- **Links to other blocks:** `[text](bblocks://<identifier>)` links to the block's clause if it
  is in this document, or to its page in the viewer if it comes from an imported register.
- **Figures** and **includes** (schemas or other files shown verbatim): see below.
- The Markdown dialect is CommonMark plus tables.

### Figures

A captioned image alone in its paragraph is a numbered figure:

```markdown
![Core classes of the model](assets/core.svg)
```

renders as `Figure 3 — Core classes of the model` below the image ("Figure A.1" in annexes).
Captions may use inline Markdown. An image without a caption, or inside running text, is a
plain image.

To refer to a figure, link to the image path; the link text defaults to "Figure N":

```markdown
The classes are shown in [](assets/core.svg), and [this diagram](assets/core.svg) too.
```

Details:

- Paths are relative to the block's own source directory. Local images are copied to
  `<id>/assets/<block>/`; a missing image aborts the run. Remote URLs work too (numbered and
  referenceable, not copied). Absolute URLs under the register's `baseURL` are mapped to the
  local file.
- **An image is shown once**, where first included. Repeats (same or other block) are
  omitted; references point to the first.
- To give a figure a stable anchor (or to say which of two images wins), add an id:
  `![Caption](assets/core.svg){#fig-core}` and refer to it with `[](#fig-core)`.
- References may point forward. A link to an image that is not a figure produces a warning.
- Prefer SVG over PNG when you have both.

### Including schemas and other files

A fenced code block with an `include=` option, and no content, is filled at build time with
the content of a file, so that a schema published by a building block appears in the document
without being copied into `description.md` (the equivalent of AsciiDoc's
`include::openapi/schemas/link.yaml[]`):

````markdown
```yaml include=bblocks://ogc.api.common.part1.schemas.link
```
````

The first word is the language (it sets the `language-…` class of the code block, as in any
fence). `include=` takes:

| Value | Includes |
|---|---|
| `bblocks://<identifier>` | the block's schema, as written by its authors (`sourceSchema` in the register) |
| `bblocks://<identifier>` with `schema=annotated` | the block's annotated schema from the build (`schema` in the register: the JSON one if the language is `json`, the YAML one otherwise). It carries the semantic annotations (`x-jsonld-*`) and absolute `$ref`s |
| an absolute URL | that URL (mapped to the local file when under the register's `baseURL`) |
| a relative path | a file relative to the block's own source directory, as for images |

The block can be local or come from an imported register. The included text is shown
verbatim (escaped, never parsed as Markdown), so YAML `#` comments do not become headings.
An include that cannot be resolved (unknown block, block without that schema, missing file,
failed download) aborts the run. Content inside the fence is replaced, with a warning.

**Link to the defining building block.** The code block is followed by a line
"Building block: <identifier>", linked to the block's clause if it is in this document, or to
its page in the viewer if it comes from an imported register. The block is:

- for `include=bblocks://<identifier>`, that block;
- for a URL, the block whose source or annotated schema is at that URL (`http` and `https`
  alike), if any;
- `bblock=<identifier>` sets it explicitly (for instance when including the official copy of a
  schema that a block republishes), and `bblock=none` removes the line.

````markdown
```yaml include=https://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/landingPage.yaml bblock=ogc.api.common.part1.schemas.landingPage
```
````

A caption is ordinary Markdown next to the block. Pair the include with a requirement's
`applies-to` (which renders the property table and links to the block) when the schema is
normative for that requirement.

## Terms: `terms.yaml`

```yaml
terms:
  - term: coordinate operation
    definition: >
      Process for changing coordinates in a source CRS to coordinates in a target CRS.
    sources:                       # optional
      - title: ISO 19111:2019
        uri: https://www.iso.org/standard/74039.html
    note: Optional note.           # optional; shown as an editor's note

abbreviated-terms:                 # optional; abbreviation: expansion
  CRS: coordinate reference system
```

Terms are sorted alphabetically. `description.md` in the same block, if present, is shown as
the introduction of the clause.

## References: `references.yaml`

```yaml
normative:
  - title: "OpenAPI Specification 3.0"      # required
    doc-id: OAS 3.0                          # sort key and citation label
    uri: http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.4
    date: "2020"
informative:
  - title: "…"
    doc-id: …
```

`description.md`, if present, is shown before the lists.

## Requirements classes: `requirements.yaml`

```yaml
class-id: core                  # optional, see "Class ids"
standardization-target: Web API # optional

depends-on:                     # optional: other conformance classes this one requires
  - bblock: my.std.part1.requirements.common     # a class in this standard
  - uri: bblocks://some.other.block               # resolved to the block's name and link
  - uri: http://example.org/spec/conf/x           # any URI
    title: Some other class

requirements:
  - id: core/landing-page       # required; the URI is derived as <req-uri-template> with this id
    level: SHALL                # default SHALL; also SHOULD, MAY, SHALL NOT, SHOULD NOT
    statement: >                # Markdown
      The server SHALL support the HTTP GET operation at the path `/`.
    condition: …                # optional; shown with the requirement
    note: …                     # optional
    applies-to:                 # optional
      bblock: my.std.api.paths.LandingPage
      json-path: $.properties.links   # optional, default $; selects the schema node
    tested-by:                  # optional; ids or file names from the block's tests.yaml
      - landing-page-success
    import-examples: 2          # optional: pull up to N examples from the applies-to block
```

Notes:

- **Requirement ids** conventionally start with the class id (`core/landing-page`): the id is
  substituted verbatim into the URI template, so `core/landing-page` gives `…/req/core/landing-page`.
- **`applies-to`** links the requirement to a block, and, when that block has a JSON Schema,
  adds a property table (name, type, required, description) for the selected `json-path`.
- **`tested-by`**: matched, in order, against the `id` and then the file name (with or
  without extension) of the block's test resources (`tests.yaml`, as published in
  `register.json`). If omitted, all of the block's test resources are listed. Each
  requirement also yields an entry in the Abstract Test Suite annex.
- **Examples:** the block's own `examples.yaml` examples are listed after the requirements
  (they come from the block's `json-full` documentation). `import-examples` appends examples
  of *another* block under a requirement. Images in an example are resolved against the block
  the example comes from.
- **`description.md`** is the class introduction. To put text *after* the requirements
  instead, insert the line `<!-- requirements -->`: everything before it is shown above the
  requirements, everything after it below.
- `req-class-uri` and `conformance-class-uri` in `bblock.json` override the derived class URIs.

### Class ids

The class id is the segment in `…/req/<id>` and `…/conf/<id>`. It is, in order of
precedence:

1. `class-id` in the block's `requirements.yaml`;
2. the block identifier with `class-id-prefix` removed, if the standard sets one;
3. the block identifier with the standard's `prefix` removed;
4. (blocks outside the standard) the last segment of the identifier.

Dots become `/`. Use `class-id-prefix` to keep requirements grouped in the register without the
group leaking into URIs: with `prefix: my.std.part1` and
`class-id-prefix: my.std.part1.requirements.`, the block `my.std.part1.requirements.core` gets
the class id `core`. `class-id-prefix` must start with `prefix`.

### Recommendations, permissions and lettered parts

A `requirements.yaml` entry can also be a recommendation or a permission (ModSpec), and can be
split into lettered parts (A, B, C…), as in published OGC documents:

```yaml
requirements:
  - id: core/deploy-body              # → {req-uri-template}: …/req/core/deploy-body
    parts:
      - The body SHALL contain …
      - The `Content-Type` header SHALL …
  - id: core/deploy-body              # same id is fine for a different type
    type: permission                  # requirement (default) | recommendation | permission
    statement: A server MAY …         # → {per-uri-template}: …/per/core/deploy-body
  - id: cwl/multipart
    type: permission
    prerequisites: [RFC 2387 (The MIME Multipart/Related Content-type)]
    statement: Introduction shown as "Statement" when there are parts.
    parts: [A server MAY …, Parts SHOULD …]
```

A statement can also carry the ModSpec rows `label`, `conditions` and `description` (Markdown),
shown as "Label", "Conditions" and "Description" before its parts.

`level` defaults to SHALL, SHOULD and MAY respectively. URIs come from `rec-uri-template` and
`per-uri-template` (defaults `{base-uri}/{status}rec/{id}` and `{base-uri}/{status}per/{id}`).
`applies-to: {bblock: …, table: false}` links the block without adding its property table (e.g.
when the statement already quotes the schema). Other class-level keys: `title` (title of the
requirements class table, default: the block name), `obligation` (default `requirement`).

### Placing the class table and statements in the text

By default the class table comes first and all statements follow the intro text, under a
"Requirements" heading. Markers on their own line in `description.md` place them instead:

```markdown
## Overview
<!-- requirements-class -->
…
## Deploy
<!-- requirement: core/deploy-body -->
<!-- permission: core/deploy-body -->
<!-- recommendation: core/deploy-body-ogcapppkg -->
```

Statements without a marker still go under the "Requirements" heading (which is omitted when
every statement is placed). Statements are numbered in display order.

A statement marker can also be put in another clause: a prose clause, a preface clause or the
Annex A block (for example a recommendation of the "Job list" class shown in the security
considerations). The statement is then shown there instead, and numbered there: in Annex A it
gets an annex number ("Requirement A.1"). Its class table still lists it.

### Explicit abstract tests

Instead of one generated Annex A entry per requirement, a class can list its abstract tests:

```yaml
conformance-class:
  title: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy   # default: the block name
  subject: …                         # optional
abstract-tests:
  - id: dru/deploy-post-op           # → {ats-uri-template} (default {base-uri}/{status}conf/{id})
    requirement: deploy-replace-undeploy/deploy-post-op   # id, identifier (/req/…) or URI; or a list
    purpose: Validate that …
    method: |
      1. Issue an HTTP POST request …
    tested-by: [deploy-success]      # optional, from the block's tests.yaml
  - id: dru/other
    requirement: {ref: deploy-replace-undeploy/x, text: /req/shown/as/written}
```

`conformance-class` can also give `prerequisites` (Markdown, one per entry). `abstract-tests: []`
says that the class has no abstract tests: none are then generated for it.

A requirement reference that resolves is linked (and shown as "Requirement N: /req/…" in the
`ogc` layout unless `text` is given); one that does not is shown as written, with a warning.
To lay out the annex, give it a block: `{auto: annex-a, bblock: my.std.annexes.ats}`. Its
`description.md` is the annex text, with `<!-- conformance-class: <class block id> -->` and
`<!-- abstract-test: <id> -->` markers; an optional `abstract-tests.yaml` (`abstract-tests:` list)
next to it holds tests that belong to no conformance class. As soon as one class has
abstract tests (or the annex has a block), classes without any get one generated test per
requirement.

## Document layout

### Preface, clause titles and unnumbered clauses

```yaml
preface:                          # before clause 1, numbered I, II, III…
  - auto: abstract                # the 'abstract' (Markdown); no longer shown on the cover
  - auto: keywords
  - bblock: my.std.clauses.security
clauses:
  - bblock: my.std.requirements.core
    title: Requirements Class “Core”      # overrides the block name
  - bblock: my.std.annexes.bibliography
    numbered: false                       # e.g. a closing Bibliography
```

A clause can list `subclauses`, rendered as its subclauses after its own text: a group clause
"10" whose `description.md` has an "Overview" heading (10.1) gets 10.2, 10.3… for the listed
blocks, typically requirements classes:

```yaml
clauses:
  - bblock: my.std.clauses.encodings       # its description.md: "# Overview" -> 10.1
    subclauses:
      - bblock: my.std.requirements.json   # 10.2
        title: Requirements Class “JSON”
      - bblock: my.std.requirements.html   # 10.3
```

In `terms.yaml` and `references.yaml`, `sort: false` keeps the order of the file. A reference
can give its full `citation` (Markdown) instead of `doc-id`/`title`/`date`, and an `anchor` (the
HTML id of the entry) so that the text can link to it: `[OGC 18-062r2](#OAProc-1)`.

### `layout: ogc`

`layout: ogc` in a standard's entry renders it like a published OGC (Metanorma) document:

- statements, requirements classes, conformance classes and abstract tests as ModSpec tables
  (Identifier, Included in, A/B/C parts…), identifiers shown relative to `base-uri`
  (`/req/core/x`);
- statements numbered across the document per kind (Requirement 1…n, Permission 1…n);
- headings in clause text numbered (6.1, 6.1.2…), with `sec-<number>` anchors, so that
  `[Clause 6.2](#sec-6.2)` links work, preface headings lettered (IV.A); terms rendered as
  subclauses; a `#` line inside a fenced code block is not a heading;
- a table of contents listing subclauses down to 6.1.2.3, without the terms;
- annexes titled "Annex A (normative) …" (`normative: false` → informative);
- an OGC-style cover (`external-id`, `doc-subtype`, `submission-date`, `approval-date`,
  `pub-date`, version);
- its styles in a separate `ogc-layout.css`, copied and linked only for this layout, so that
  documents in the `classic` layout keep their exact output.

`modspec` adjusts the ModSpec tables to the document being reproduced:

```yaml
modspec:
  statement-label: Statement   # header of a statement without parts (default: A)
  singular-labels: true        # "Prerequisite", "Normative statement", "Conformance test"
                               # when there is only one (default: false)
  obligation-row: false        # no "Obligation" row in class tables (default: true)
```

`boilerplate.notices` (both layouts) replaces the default copyright/patent/license text with
your own titled Markdown blocks:

```yaml
boilerplate:
  copyright-year: 2019
  notices:
    - {title: Notice for Drafts, text: "This document is not an OGC Standard. …"}
```

The default layout (`classic`) is unchanged.

## Model blocks and ontology blocks as requirements classes

A requirements class is not tied to `itemClass: requirements-class`. A block of any
`itemClass` (for example `model`) that has a `requirements.yaml` becomes a requirements class
and keeps all of its normal bblock content (schema, ontology, examples, tests). Set
`class-id` explicitly when its identifier does not carry a meaningful class path.

### Ontology tables

A requirement with `applies-to: {bblock: <id>}` gets a property table built from the block's
JSON Schema. If the block has no schema properties but does have an `ontology` in the
register (an `ontology.ttl`), the requirement gets a "classes" table (subclass-of,
definition) and a "properties" table (domain, range, definition) instead, listing the terms
the ontology itself defines (named classes and object/datatype/annotation properties).
Labels and definitions prefer English. By default the tables list the whole ontology; add
`terms` to `applies-to` to list only some of it (local names, or CURIEs whose prefix is
ignored):

```yaml
applies-to:
  bblock: my.std.model
  terms: [CoordinateOperation, geosrs:SingleOperation]
```

## A minimal complete example

`bblocks-config.yaml` (excerpt):

```yaml
identifier-prefix: my.std.
plugins:
  build:
    - classes: [standard_gen.plugin.SpecgenBuildPlugin]
      pip: [bblocks-specgen @ git+https://github.com/ogcincubator/bblocks-specgen]
```

`standards.yaml`:

```yaml
standards:
  - id: core
    prefix: my.std.
    title: My Standard
    base-uri: http://www.opengis.net/spec/my-std/1.0
    doc-number: OGC 24-001
    clauses:
      - my.std.scope
      - {auto: conformance}
      - my.std.model
      - {auto: annex-a}
```

`_sources/scope/bblock.json` (`name`, `status`, `dateTimeAddition`, `itemClass` and `version` are
the only fields the bblocks schema requires; see the bblocks-postprocess docs for the rest):

```json
{ "name": "Scope", "itemClass": "clause", "status": "under-development",
  "dateTimeAddition": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z", "version": "1.0" }
```

`_sources/scope/description.md`:

```markdown
This standard defines …
```

`_sources/model/bblock.json` — a model block that is also a requirements class:

```json
{ "name": "Model", "itemClass": "model", "status": "under-development",
  "dateTimeAddition": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z", "version": "1.0" }
```

`_sources/model/requirements.yaml`:

```yaml
class-id: model
requirements:
  - id: model/classes
    statement: An implementation SHALL use the classes defined in [](assets/classes.svg).
```

`_sources/model/description.md`:

```markdown
## Classes

![Classes of the model](assets/classes.svg)
```

`_sources/model/assets/classes.svg` — the image must exist, or the run aborts:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="60">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="180" height="40" fill="none" stroke="black"/>
  <text x="100" y="35" text-anchor="middle">Feature</text>
</svg>
```

Run `bblocks-postprocess` (which runs the plugin), then open
`standards/core/index.html`; `standards/core/report.json` shows how each block was used.

## Troubleshooting

- **A block shows up as prose but should be a requirements class** — check `report.json`:
  specgen did not find `requirements.yaml` next to the block's `bblock.json`.
- **URIs look like `/req/requirements/core`** — the class id defaults to the identifier minus
  `prefix`; set `class-id-prefix` or `class-id`.
- **The run aborts on an image** — the image path is relative to the *block's* source
  directory, not to the repository root or to `standards.yaml`.
- **Any failure aborts the whole run**; the top-level index is only written after every
  standard has rendered successfully.
